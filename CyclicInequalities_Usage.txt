CyclicInequalities Package - Usage Instructions
================================================

The CyclicInequalities.m package contains all functions that were previously 
scattered between CyclicInequalities.nb and CyclicTools.wl, now consolidated 
into a single, readable package file.

Loading the Package:
--------------------
To use the package in Mathematica, load it with:

    << CyclicInequalities`

Or if the package is not in the Mathematica path:

    Get["path/to/CyclicInequalities.m"]

Available Functions:
--------------------
1. VectorCyclicSum[f, u] 
   - Builds a cyclic sum of local terms f(u_i, u_{i-1}, u_{i+1})

2. CyclicSum[term, n]
   - Symbolic cyclic sum with boundary conditions u[0]=u[n], u[n+1]=u[1]

3. CyclicAverage[expr, vars]
   - Average of expr under all cyclic rotations of vars

4. CyclicCanonicalize[expr, vars]
   - Lexicographically minimal rotation of expr

5. FindEdgeSOSAnsatz[p, q]
   - Finds edge-wise SOS representation for cubic templates

6. ProveExampleInequality[N]
   - Proves Sum[u_i (u_{i-1}^2 - 4 u_i^2 + 3 u_{i+1}^2)] <= 0 for u_i >= 0

Example Usage:
--------------
    << CyclicInequalities`
    
    (* Run the automated proof for N=5 *)
    result = ProveExampleInequality[5]
    
    (* Check if the identity holds *)
    result["IdentityHolds"]
    
    (* View the edge weights *)
    result["EdgeWeights"]

For detailed documentation, use the built-in help:
    ?VectorCyclicSum
    ?ProveExampleInequality

Package Location:
-----------------
This package consolidates functions from:
- notebooks/CyclicInequalities/CyclicTools.wl
- notebooks/CyclicInequalities/CyclicInequalities.nb

The package file CyclicInequalities.m is a simple ASCII text file that is 
human-readable and can be easily edited with any text editor.
